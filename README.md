# Passwordstore gnome manager

Gnome-shell extension to access your passwords from the password store [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

### Installing
Since the extension is not yet on the gnome shell extension store, you can clone the repository in
`.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`

## How it works
- Click on a folder to open it
- Click on an item to copy the password into the clipboard
- Click on the current path to go up a level

## Contributing
The extension is still in a very early phase, but PR's and issues are appreciated :D
